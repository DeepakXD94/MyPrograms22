A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that ahs modules and other packages 
within it. Like modules, you can very easily create packages in Python.

Every package in Python is a directory which must have a special file called __init__.py. This file may not even have a single line of code
It is simply added to indicate that this package is not an oridnary directory and contains a Python Package.

Packages are imported in the same way modules are imported.
